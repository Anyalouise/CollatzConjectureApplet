# Collatz Conjecture Applet

Given any integer, if it is even, divide it by two, and if it is odd multiply it by three and add one, and repeat.  The Collatz Conjecture states that this loop will always
converge to one (more specifically, a (4, 2, 1) loop). While the conjecture has not been proven, it has been verified for every number less than 2<sup>68</sup>.

This applet runs random numbers through the conjecture path, and graphs the pathways they take, and logs of them.
